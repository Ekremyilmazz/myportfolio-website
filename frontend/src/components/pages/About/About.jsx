        <p>
          I am a dedicated and detail-oriented software developer with a strong
          passion for creating innovative solutions. With experience in web
          development, API design, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and chatbot
          development, I thrive on building functional, user-friendly
          applications that solve real-world problems. My journey has led me to
          work with modern technologies like React, Node.js, and TypeScript,
          allowing me to stay up-to-date with industry trends and best
          practices.
        </p>{" "}
        <br />
        <p>
          I believe in writing clean, efficient code and delivering projects
          that meet both technical and business requirements. Whether itâ€™s
          automating processes, developing smart assistants, or creating
          powerful APIs, I enjoy pushing boundaries and constantly improving my
          skills. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects and provide
          value through technology-driven solutions.
